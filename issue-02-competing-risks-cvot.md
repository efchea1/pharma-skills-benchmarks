## Query
I'm designing a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial. Primary endpoint is time to cardiovascular death. Patients have established CVD. 1:1 randomization. Control arm CV death rate is about 2.5% per year. We also expect about 2% per year non-cardiovascular death in this population. Treatment effect on CV death: hazard ratio 0.80. Non-CV death is not expected to be affected by treatment. Target 90% power, two-sided alpha 0.05. One interim analysis at 50% of CV death events, O'Brien-Fleming spending, non-binding futility. Enrollment 9,000 patients over 48 months, minimum 24 months follow-up. Design the trial.

## Expected Output
The skill should recognize that non-CV death is a competing risk for the primary endpoint of CV death, a patient who dies of a non-CV cause can no longer experience CV death, so treating non-CV deaths as independent censoring (which `gsDesign::nSurv()` does by default) overstates the observed CV death rate and produces an incorrectly sized trial. The skill should:
1. Flag that non-CV death at 2%/year is a substantial competing event (~44% of all deaths in this population are non-CV), and that this creates a competing risks problem for the primary endpoint
2. Distinguish between two estimands: cause-specific (Cox/log-rank, treating non-CV deaths as censored) and subdistribution (Fine-Gray, directly modeling the cumulative incidence of CV death). These give different required event counts
3. Under cause-specific analysis: the all-cause event rate used in `lrstat` event prediction must be 4.5%/year (CV + non-CV), not 2.5%/year. Using only 2.5%/year will project the wrong calendar time to the required number of CV events
4. Under Fine-Gray sizing: the subdistribution HR is attenuated relative to the cause-specific HR (~0.82-0.84 vs 0.80) because competing events inflate the subdistribution risk set, requiring more CV events (~600-650 vs ~520-540)
5. Flag that `gsDesign::nSurv()` implements cause-specific (log-rank) analysis only, and is not equivalent to Fine-Gray sizing if the SAP pre-specifies Gray's test
6. Ask which estimand is intended, or state the assumption made

## Rubric Criteria (Assertions)
* Output explicitly mentions competing risks, competing event, or non-CV death as a methodological issue, not just a demographic parameter
* `gsd_results.json` contains an all-cause event rate or total hazard that is ≥ 4.0%/year (not just the CV death rate of 2.5%/year alone)
* Output distinguishes cause-specific from subdistribution estimand, or explicitly states which estimand is assumed and why
* If cause-specific analysis is used, required CV events is in the range 500-560; if Fine-Gray sizing is used, required CV events is ≥ 580
* Output flags that `gsDesign::nSurv()` treats competing events as independent censoring and is not equivalent to Fine-Gray subdistribution sizing
* `gsd_verification_log.md` confirms simulated power ≥ 88% under a model that includes competing event removal from the at-risk set, not a model that ignores non-CV deaths
* Calendar time to final analysis reported in `gsd_results.json` accounts for the competing event reducing the observed CV death rate below 2.5%/year (projected final analysis ≥ 60 months from first patient in)
* `gsd_results.json` must contain "min_followup", "min_gap", and "feasible_range" keys (per the skill's required JSON schema), and the "feasible_range" upper bound must be consistent with the 9,000 patient enrollment specified. If the skill uses only the CV death rate (2.5%/year) without competing event adjustment, the projected calendar time to final analysis stored in `gsd_results.json` will be< 60 months, which is a failing answer, as the competing event removal from the at-risk set extends the timeline beyond this
